Etymology
Main article: Names of Bengal
The exact origin of the word Bangla is unknown, though it is believed to come from "Vanga", an ancient kingdom and geopolitical division on the Ganges delta in the 
Indian subcontinent. It was located in southern Bengal, with the core region including present-day southern West Bengal (India) and southwestern Bangladesh. In Islamic 
tradition, it is said to come from "Bung/Bang", a son of Hind (the son of Hām, who was a son of Noah) who colonised the area for the first time.[30] The suffix "al" came 
to be added to it from the fact that the ancient rajas of this land raised mounds of earth 10 feet high and 20 in breadth in lowlands at the foot of the hills which were 
called "al". From this suffix added to the Bung, the name Bengal arose and gained currency".[31][32] Support for this view is found in Ghulam Husain Salim's Riyaz-us-Salatin.[30]

Other theories point to a Bronze Age proto-Dravidian tribe,[33] the Austric word "Bonga" (Sun god),[34][self-published source?] and the Iron Age Vanga Kingdom.[34] The Indo-Aryan 
suffix Desh is derived from the Sanskrit word deśha, which means "land" or "country". Hence, the name Bangladesh means "Land of Bengal" or "Country of Bengal".[35]

The term Bangla denotes both the Bengal region and the Bengali language. The earliest known usage of the term is the Nesari plate in 805 AD. The term Vangaladesa is 
found in 11th-century South Indian records.[35][36] The term gained official status during the Sultanate of Bengal in the 14th century.[37][38] Shamsuddin Ilyas Shah 
proclaimed himself as the first "Shah of Bangala" in 1342.[37] The word Bangla became the most common name for the region during the Islamic period. The Portuguese referred 
to the region as Bengala in the 16th century.[39] The term Bangladesh was often written as two words, Bangla Desh, in the past. Starting in the 1950s, Bengali nationalists used 
the term in political rallies in East Pakistan.
